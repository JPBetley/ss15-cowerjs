            	<p>Here's an example: John has made plans to have Joe, James, Jake and Jane over to watch the Big Game next weekend. But they're going to need something to munch on during all those timeouts and commercial breaks. So John logs into Chips Or Something and imports his Facebook event, inviting his friends to join him on COS. There, they agree that Pizza, Wings, Beer, Salad and (of course!) Chips are necessary items to bring. Each person claims an item they are willing to bring. John uses COS to make a pinned post back on the Facebook Event page with the now-completed list, while the invitees have COS send them an alert notification with their claimed item to remind them what to buy on their next grocery run. The following Sunday, everyone brings their A-game, and also their item!</p>
